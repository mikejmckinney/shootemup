## Purpose
World map showing branching route selection with risk/reward node visualization.

## Composition Notes
Node-based map view. Multiple path branches visible. Risk indicators on harder routes. Reward indicators differ by path. Current position marked.

## Prompt
Branching world map screen for modern arcade shooter anti-repetition system. HD 2D vector-style illustration, clean geometric shapes, flat color surfaces with subtle gradients, smooth edges. Stage select map view showing multiple branching paths. Node-based layout with clear route options. Each node: encounter type icon (scroll stage, arena, hunt, hazard indicators). Risk/reward branch: harder path shows danger icon with higher reward indicator, easier path shows standard rewards. Current player position highlighted in cyan. Completed nodes dimmed. Upcoming nodes bright. Dark space background. Minimalist floating panel for route info. Clean readable at a glance. Modern arcade aesthetic.

## Negative Prompt
pixel art, retro style, texture noise, linear single path, cluttered nodes, realistic terrain, painterly, busy background, fog

## Consistency Constraints
- UI panel style: floating panel for route info
- Icon style: encounter type icons (scroll, arena, hunt, hazard)
- Color palette: dark space background, cyan current position, varied node brightness
- Map style: node-based layout with branching paths
