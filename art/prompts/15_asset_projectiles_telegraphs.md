## Purpose
Projectile and telegraph asset sheet showing all damage types and warning indicators.

## Composition Notes
Organized by type: beam, bolt, spread, homing, AoE. Telegraph shapes separate section. Clear visual distinction between types.

## Prompt
Projectile and telegraph asset sheet for modern arcade shooter. HD 2D vector-style illustration, clean geometric shapes, flat color surfaces with subtle gradients, smooth edges. Dark navy background. Projectile section: beam (thin straight line with endpoint), bolt (rounded capsule with trail), spread (small triangles/chevrons), homing (teardrop with curve trail), AoE boundary (circle/cone/arc). Telegraph section: outline warning shapes, wedge patterns, arc indicators at 50% opacity. Player projectiles in cyan. Enemy projectiles in red/orange. Telegraphs brighter than projectiles. Each type clearly labeled with icon. Asset sheet format.

## Negative Prompt
pixel art, retro style, texture noise, identical projectiles, unclear telegraphs, cluttered, realistic, painterly, overlapping elements

## Consistency Constraints
- Projectile style: beam (straight line), bolt (capsule), spread (triangles), homing (teardrop), AoE (boundary shapes)
- Telegraph style: outline shapes, wedges, arcs at 50% opacity
- Color palette: cyan for player projectiles, red/orange for enemy projectiles
