## Purpose
Boss variant comparison showing same silhouette with different attack pattern telegraphs.

## Composition Notes
Split or side-by-side view. Same boss base silhouette. Different telegraph patterns shown (one with beam sweep, one with radial burst). Variant indicator visible.

## Prompt
Boss variant comparison for modern arcade shooter anti-repetition system. HD 2D vector-style illustration, clean geometric shapes, flat color surfaces with subtle gradients, smooth edges. Side-by-side boss encounter comparison. Same boss base silhouette (large graphic form, red/orange identity) shown twice. Left variant: beam sweep telegraph pattern (arc indicator). Right variant: radial burst telegraph pattern (circle indicators). Variant label/icon differentiating each. Same readable appendages, different attack patterns. Dark background. Clean separation. Demonstrates pattern variety while maintaining silhouette consistency. Telegraph clarity emphasized. Modern arcade aesthetic.

## Negative Prompt
pixel art, retro style, texture noise, completely different boss shapes, cluttered telegraphs, realistic, painterly, unclear patterns, busy background

## Consistency Constraints
- Boss shape language: same base silhouette for both variants
- Telegraph style: distinct patterns (beam sweep vs radial burst)
- Color palette: dark background, red/orange boss identity
