## Composition Notes
Boss dominates upper half. Player ship in lower third. Large telegraph shapes (arcs, wedges) clearly visible at 50% opacity. Boss HP bar with phase markers at top center.

## Prompt

Large graphic boss form with red/orange identity in upper half, clear readable appendages, negative space for readability. Angular player ship (cyan/blue) in lower portion. Bright telegraph indicators: arc-shaped warning zones, wedge attack patterns at 50-60% opacity, clearer than actual projectiles. Boss HP bar at top center with visible phase markers. Dark subdued background. Minimalist floating HUD panels in corners. Controlled glow on telegraphs. Unmistakable danger zones. Premium modern arcade aesthetic.
