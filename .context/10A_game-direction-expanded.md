# Game Direction (Expanded) — Hybrid Stage Select + Mixed Encounters

## Core Promise
Fast, replayable runs with meaningful build choice, modern anti-repetition systems, and fair skill-based weekly challenges.

---

## Run Structure (Target 8–15 min)
1) Choose route on world map (branching nodes)
2) Play 3–6 encounters (mixed types)
3) Mid-run mini-boss or event
4) Final boss (with variants)
5) Rewards + meta progression

---

## Encounter Types (Design Targets)
- Scroll stage: authored pacing, setpieces, “shmup feeling”
- Arena: survive timer, escalating waves
- Hunt: track and defeat miniboss(es)
- Escort/defend: protect objective with positioning challenges
- Hazard room: rule changes (low visibility, gravity shift, etc.)

Each biome should include at least 3 encounter types.

---

## Anti-Repetition Systems (Visual + System)
- Route branching: visible risk/reward choices
- Run modifiers: global rules that change play
- Random events: “choose one” moments on map nodes
- Boss variants: alternate patterns, telegraphs, phases
- Objective variety: scoring incentives differ per run

---

## Progression Philosophy
- In-run progression creates builds
- Meta progression expands options
- Competitive modes normalize power to protect fairness

---

## Weekly Challenge (Fair)
- Standard loadout + normalized stats
- Fixed seed
- Score based on skill (accuracy, damage avoided, objective tempo)
- Leaderboards remain meaningful without grind
