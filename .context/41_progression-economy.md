# Progression & Economy (Authoritative)

## In-Run Progression
- XP drops → level ups
- Each level: 3 choices + optional reroll (limited per run)
- Build identity should emerge by minute 3–5

## Meta Progression
- Unlock ships (different starting loadouts / traits)
- Unlock modules (starting options / utility)
- Unlock cosmetics (skins, trails, VFX variants, UI themes)

## Fairness Rules
- Competitive modes (weekly challenges) use normalized power
- Meta unlocks provide variety/options, not permanent advantage

## Rewards
- Runs grant currency for cosmetics + unlocks
- Milestones grant cosmetic bundles and new ship options
