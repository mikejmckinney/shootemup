# Gameplay Systems (Authoritative)

## Core Combat Loop
- Move + aim/auto-fire (configurable)
- Dodge telegraphed threats
- Collect XP + pickups
- Level up → choose upgrades → build evolves
- Encounter objectives vary by stage type

## Weapon System
- Weapons have archetypes: beam, burst, spread, drone, lightning, AoE
- Each weapon supports upgrades that change behavior (not just damage)
- Synergies exist between weapons and passives (build diversity goal)

## Passive System
- Passives modify playstyle: shield, crit, magnet, cooldown, ammo/heat, movement
- Passives can unlock synergy effects when paired with certain weapons

## Encounter Types
- Scroll stage: authored pacing + setpieces
- Arena: survive timers + elite waves
- Hunt: miniboss targets with clear tells
- Escort/defend: protect objective with risk-reward routes
- Hazard rooms: environmental rules change combat

## Boss Design Rules
- Telegraphs must be clearer than bullets
- Variant bosses reuse silhouette but swap attack patterns
- Phase changes are visually obvious
