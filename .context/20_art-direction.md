# Art Direction — Modern Arcade Shooter (Authoritative)

## Visual Goal
Modern arcade sci-fi shooter that feels clean, premium, highly readable, and timeless.

## Rendering Style
- HD 2D vector-style illustration
- Clean geometric shapes
- Smooth edges
- Flat color surfaces with restrained gradients
- No texture noise or grit

## Color & Contrast
- Dark, subdued backgrounds
- Bright, saturated gameplay elements
- Color as information
- Strong separation: player vs enemies vs projectiles vs background

## Shape Language
- Player: sharp, angular, arrow-like silhouette
- Enemies: bold simple shapes, clear roles, elites distinct
- Bosses: large graphic forms, negative space for readability

## Projectiles & Telegraphs
- Lasers: clean straight beams
- Plasma: rounded bolts
- AoE: circles/cones/arcs with clear boundaries
- Telegraphs are brighter and clearer than damage projectiles

## VFX

- Used for timing, danger, reward
- Never obscures bullets or enemy silhouettes

## UI/HUD
- Minimalist sci-fi HUD
- Floating panels
- Icon-first
- Legible numbers
- Grid-aligned layout

## Motion Feel
