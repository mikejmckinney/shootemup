# Game Direction — Primary Direction (Authoritative)

## Project Overview
Modern arcade-style shoot ’em up / survivor-shmup hybrid designed for quick sessions, high replayability, and long-term progression without pay-to-win mechanics.

Design goals:
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Clear readability during high intensity
- Build diversity and meaningful choices
- Anti-repetition systems baked in
- Competitive modes are skill-based and fair

## Primary Direction
**Hybrid: Stage-Select World Map + Scrolling Stages + Arena Events**

## Camera & Perspective
- Primary: top-down
- Occasional: vertical scrolling segments for classic shmup pacing
- No rotation or distortion
- Readability first

## Session Loop
- Typical run: 8–15 minutes
- Fast restarts
- Run structure: choose route → play mixed encounters → boss/variant boss → rewards → meta progression

## Anti-Repetition Pillars
- Branching routes (risk/reward choices)
- Run modifiers (rules that change encounters)
- Biome-specific hazards and enemy themes
- Boss variants with different telegraphs
- Objective variety (survive, escort, hunt miniboss, hold zone, timed clear)

## Progression
### In-Run
- Leveling during run
- Weapon + passive + synergy choices
- Builds can meaningfully change gameplay

### Meta
- Unlock ships, modules, cosmetics, and options
- No permanent stat advantages in competitive modes

## Weekly Challenges
- Standardized loadout
- Normalized stats
- Fixed seed per challenge
- Skill-only leaderboards

## Monetization
- Cosmetics only (skins, VFX variants, UI themes)
- No power boosts
- No pay-to-win
