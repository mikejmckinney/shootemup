# Art Direction — Modern Arcade Shooter

## Visual Goal

Create a **modern arcade sci-fi shooter** that feels:
- Clean
- Premium
- Highly readable
- Timeless (not retro, not gritty realism)

The visual style should feel appropriate for:
- Mobile premium games
- PC indie releases
- Console arcade experiences

The game should not visually reference any specific era.
It should feel contemporary and forward-looking.

---

## Core Visual Identity

### Rendering Style
- HD 2D illustration
- Clean vector-style geometry
- Smooth edges
- Flat color surfaces with restrained gradients
- No texture noise or visual grit

Visuals should feel like they were designed in:
- Illustrator
- Figma
- Modern 2D game engines

---

## Color & Contrast Philosophy

- Dark, subdued backgrounds
- Bright, saturated gameplay elements
- Strong contrast between:
  - Player
  - Enemies
  - Projectiles
  - Environment

Color is used as **information**, not decoration.

---

## Shape Language

### Player
- Sharp, angular silhouettes
- Arrow-like forward motion
- Instantly recognizable at small sizes

### Enemies
- Bold, simple shapes
- Clear role differentiation
- Elites and bosses use asymmetry and scale

### Bosses
- Large, graphic forms
- Clear negative space
- Attacks are visually telegraphed with shapes, not particles

---

## Weapons & Projectiles

- Lasers: straight, clean beams
- Plasma: rounded, contained bolts
- AoE: circles, cones, or arcs with clear boundaries
- Each weapon type has a distinct visual language

Projectiles must always be readable against the background.

---

## Visual Effects

- Minimal but impactful
- Used to communicate timing, danger, and reward
- No visual noise
- No lingering effects that obscure gameplay

Effects should enhance clarity, not spectacle for its own sake.

---

## UI & HUD Design

- Minimalist sci-fi interface
- Floating panels
- Icon-first communication
- Large, legible numbers
- Clear spacing and hierarchy

UI should feel modern and functional, not decorative.

---

## Motion & Feel

- Subtle idle motion
- Snappy reactions
- Fast, clean transitions
- Limited screen shake
- Feedback should feel precise and intentional

---

## Overall Impression

The game should look:
- Modern
- Clean
- Confident
- Skill-focused

If a player sees a screenshot, it should immediately communicate:
“This is a modern arcade shooter built for clarity and mastery.”
