# UI Principles (Authoritative)

## UI Goals
- At-a-glance readability during intense combat
- Minimal text; icons first
- Consistent placement and hierarchy

## HUD Layout Rules
- Top-left: HP/Shield + status icons
- Top-right: score, timer, objective
- Bottom-left: weapon slots / cooldown indicators
- Bottom-right: dash/active ability + consumables
- Center-top (optional): boss HP bar with clear phases

## Typography Rules
- Geometric sans look
- All-caps headers
- Large numerals
- Avoid long sentences

## Interaction Rules
- Buttons large enough for mobile
- One primary action per screen
- Clear affordances: hover/press states
- Never hide core actions behind nested menus

## Visual Hierarchy
1) Player ship
2) Enemy threats & telegraphs
3) Projectiles
4) Pickups
5) UI
6) Background
